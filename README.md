## Written submission
Please explain the steps you think are necessary to perform to get a feature done, from an idea to an implemented solution that is running in production. Be as detailed as possible. 

Makee a PR with your submission to tthis repository.

The steps necessary:
1.Planning
a.(Pivotal Tracker)
Detailed planning of the idea and how the final feature should look like but with some room for changes/improvement.
That can include making Lo-Fi,notes,usage of a feature etc.

b.Voting:The team should decide how much time and effort should be spend on the feature so as it can be time boxed and expected to be done within that time frame, but also taking into account if some extra time is needed.

c.Creating tasks dividing the feature into small tasks which should be followed to achieve the featureb.

2.Execution
a.Communication:Everyone concerned should be involved in planning and any change or ideas should be clearly communicated with a feedback.Pair programming should be practised whenever possible.

b.Work In Progress -Pull Request
As soon as a feature is started a WIP PR should be generated and continuously pushed to.

b.Coding
Creating a feature branch and not working from the master or development branch and committing with clear and precise commit messages every time something workable is added.

a.Scaffolding basic structure or the gems or dependencies that are needed and making sure that the application is in working state.

b.Writting tests so that they can guide the process of development,Test Driven Development,checking the happy path and sad path so as to know that the feature is covering all the scenarios and will not break down while in production.

c.Code formatting should be checked and clear comments should be mentioned if required.

d.Commiting as soon as a test is passed or any dependencies have been added.

e.Once the feature is finished ,the PR should be put up for review.

3.Finalization
Before merging the Pr it should be checked for any comments or changes requested, if so they must be solved and then only the PR, should be merged with consent of all people involved -for better code ownership and also to know in which state the application is in.


Pointers:
1.This process by and large should be repeated for all the features(a feature is an function which solves a purpose otherwise it is NOT a feature)
2.The coder should always be open for client feedback but also needs to clearly mention the achievability of the changes requested by the client.
3.If something needs to be changed then the client need to know that it might cost more time or money and if it cannot be done then it should be politely comminacted as well.
4.Agile methodology should always be followed.
5.Sprints and scrums should always be followed.
